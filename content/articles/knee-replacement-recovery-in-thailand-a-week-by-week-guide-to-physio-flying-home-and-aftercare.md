Deciding on a knee replacement surgery is a major step towards reclaiming your mobility and quality of life. Once you’ve chosen a world-class hospital in Thailand, the next set of questions naturally turns to the recovery process. What happens after the surgery? How soon can I start physiotherapy? And, most importantly, how do I manage the flight home safely?

These are crucial questions. A successful surgical outcome is intrinsically linked to a well-managed, supportive, and safe recovery plan. Your successful recovery begins with a world-class Total Knee Replacement (Procedure), performed at  a [](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)[JCI-accredited](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/) hospital in Thailand, which sets the stage for a smooth rehabilitation. This week-by-week guide will demystify the typical recovery timeline and explain how a dedicated support system ensures you are cared for at every stage.

### **The First 72 Hours (In-Hospital Care)**

Your recovery begins the moment you leave the operating theatre. This initial period is focused on pain management and safe, early mobilisation under expert supervision.

* Expert Nursing: In your private room at JCI-accredited hospital, you will have 24/7 nursing care to manage your pain and ensure you are comfortable.
* Early Mobilisation: Within 24-48 hours, a hospital physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and take your first steps using a walker or crutches. This is vital for promoting blood flow and beginning the healing process.
* Constant Support: Throughout your hospital stay, your Sivara Health case manager is just a phone call away via your 24/7 support line, providing reassurance and coordinating with the hospital staff.

### **Week 1: Transition and Recovery in Your Hotel**

After being discharged from the hospital (typically after 3-4 days), you will move to a comfortable, recovery-friendly hotel arranged by your concierge team.

* Focus: The goal this week is to regain independence with daily activities. You will focus on walking short distances, managing swelling, and diligently performing the gentle exercises prescribed by your physiotherapist.
* Support System: Your Sivara case manager will check in on you and is on hand to arrange any necessary follow-up appointments with your surgeon before you are cleared to fly.

### **Week 2: Building Strength and Preparing for Travel**

This week is dedicated to building strength and preparing you for the journey home.

* Physiotherapy: You will likely have sessions with an outpatient physiotherapist to work on increasing your knee's range of motion and strengthening the surrounding muscles.
* Pre-Flight Check: Towards the end of the week, you will have a final post-operative check-up with your Thai surgeon, who will assess your recovery and give you the official clearance to fly home.

### **Flying Home Safely After Knee Replacement**

The flight home is a significant concern for many patients, specifically regarding comfort and the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). A carefully planned approach makes this journey safe and manageable. Our team provides specific guidance on DVT prevention, which includes:

* Wear Compression Stockings: These are essential for promoting circulation during a long flight.
* Perform In-Seat Exercises: Regularly perform simple exercises like ankle pumps, foot circles, and knee bends to keep blood flowing.
* Stay Hydrated & Mobile: Drink plenty of water and, when the seatbelt sign is off, get up to walk the aisle every hour or so.
* Inform Your Airline: We help you notify the airline that you are recovering from surgery to arrange pre-boarding and any necessary assistance at the airport.

### **Week 3 & Beyond: Aftercare and Continuity of Care at Home**

Our support doesn't end when your plane lands back home. Ensuring a smooth continuity of care is one of the most critical services we provide.

* Liaising with Your GP: We provide you with all the necessary medical documentation, surgical notes, and post-operative reports from your Thai surgeon to share with your local GP.
* Continuing Physiotherapy: We stress the importance of continuing with a local physiotherapist to build on the progress you made in Thailand.
* Remote Support: You can still contact your Sivara Health case manager if you have questions about your recovery plan. We ensure you know which post-operative signs to watch for and when to contact your local doctor.

### **Why a Supported Recovery Matters: The Sivara Philosophy**

This detailed attention to aftercare is no accident. It is a core part of our philosophy, born from our founders: a UK-trained physician and a Thai expert in behavioural and medical sciences. They created Sivara Health with the belief that a successful outcome depends on a seamless, supportive, and expertly managed journey from the initial consultation right through to your full recovery at home.

### **Plan Your Recovery with Confidence**

A successful recovery in Thailand isn’t left to chance; it's a carefully managed process designed to support you at every turn. With a clear plan and an expert team on your side, you can navigate your recovery with total confidence.
