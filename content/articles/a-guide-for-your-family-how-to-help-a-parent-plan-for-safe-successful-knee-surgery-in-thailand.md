When a parent or loved one is dealing with chronic knee pain, your first instinct is to help. Seeing them explore options like knee surgery in Thailand is a testament to their proactive approach, but it can also bring a new set of questions and concerns for you as a supportive family member. How can you be sure they are safe? How do you help them navigate the logistics?
