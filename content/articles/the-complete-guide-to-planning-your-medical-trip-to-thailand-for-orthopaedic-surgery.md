Considering orthopaedic surgery in Thailand is an exciting prospect, offering access to world-class care without the long waiting lists and high costs often found at home. But turning that prospect into a reality can feel overwhelming. Vetting hospitals, understanding costs, and arranging travel can seem like a full-time job, especially when you’re dealing with chronic joint pain.

The good news is that a complex process can be made simple with the right roadmap. This guide breaks down the entire journey into seven clear, manageable steps and shows how a dedicated orthopaedic concierge service handles the details for you, transforming an overwhelming process into a smooth, supportive, and seamless experience.

### **Step 1: The Initial Expert Consultation (From Your Home)**

**The Challenge:** Before you go any further, you need a trusted medical opinion to know if travelling for surgery is a suitable and safe option for your specific circumstances.

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** We begin with a **complimentary, no-obligation virtual triage consultation with a UK-licensed doctor**. From the comfort of your home, you can discuss your case with a medical professional who understands your background and provides an initial assessment, establishing a foundation of trust from the very beginning.

### **Step 2: Choosing a World-Class Hospital and Surgeon**

**The Challenge:** This step can involve hours of research, trying to vet hospital accreditations and find a surgeon with expertise in your required procedure, like a **robotic-assisted hip replacement.**

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** We've already done the work for you. Sivara Health exclusively partners with internationally recognised, **[JCI-accredited](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)** hospitals in Thailand, the global gold standard for patient safety. Based on your needs, we connect you with a leading surgeon to perform your **Total Hip Replacement** at a premier **JCI-accredited** facility like **Bangkok Hospital**, a renowned centre in **Bangkok**. You can read more about our commitment to quality in our guide on **whether surgery in Thailand is safe.**

### **Step 3: Receiving Your Transparent, All-Inclusive Quote**

**The Challenge:** The fear of hidden costs and surprise bills is a major source of stress. You need a clear, detailed breakdown of all expenses to budget with confidence.

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** We provide a comprehensive, itemised treatment plan and an all-inclusive package quote. This quote clearly outlines all included costs, ensuring total transparency. For a deeper look at what this covers, see our guides on **what's in an all-inclusive package** and a **[detailed cost comparison with the UK](https://sivara.health/article.html?slug=hip-replacement-cost-uk-vs-thailand-a-detailed-2025-price-breakdown-to-save-over-60)**.

### **Step 4: Managing All Travel and Accommodation Logistics**

**The Challenge:** Booking flights, finding a suitable hotel for recovery, and arranging airport transport is a daunting logistical hurdle.

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** Our core medical concierge service takes care of it all. We assist with flight suggestions, book your accommodation at a hotel that meets our standards for comfort and recovery, and arrange for a private car to meet you at the airport for a seamless, stress-free arrival.

### **Step 5: Your Arrival and Pre-Operative Process in Bangkok**

**The Challenge:** Arriving in a new country for surgery can be intimidating, from navigating to your hotel to ensuring there are no language barriers during critical medical discussions.

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** From the moment you land, your dedicated case manager is your on-the-ground support. They can accompany you to surgeon consultations to facilitate communication, ensuring you are never alone in the process.

### **Step 6: Your Surgery and In-Hospital Support**

**The Challenge:** During your hospital stay, your focus should be solely on resting and recovering, not on logistical issues or feeling isolated.

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** While you receive care at a leading facility, our team remains on hand with a 24/7 in-country support line, providing invaluable peace of mind for you and your **family back home**.

### **Step 7: Post-Operative Care and Your Journey Home**

**The Challenge:** A successful outcome depends on a well-managed recovery, including the immediate post-operative care in Thailand and a safe transition back home.

**How Sivara Health simplifies this:** We address this critical part of the journey head-on, coordinating follow-up appointments and providing clear guidance for your recovery during travel. We help bridge the gap between your care in Thailand and your GP at home, ensuring continuity of care. For more on this, read our **week-by-week knee replacement recovery guide**.

### **Why a Physician-Led Concierge Makes the Difference**

This seamless, supportive process didn’t happen by accident. Sivara Health was founded by a UK-trained physician and a Thai co-founder with a PhD in behavioural and medical sciences. Their combined expertise shapes our "Trusted Expert Companion" model, ensuring your entire journey is framed by medical oversight, expert logistical management, and genuine, empathetic care.

### **Your Roadmap, Simplified**

While this list of steps may seem long, the purpose of a service like Sivara Health is to manage them for you. Your role is simply to focus on preparing for a successful surgery and a smooth recovery. Our role is to handle the rest.
