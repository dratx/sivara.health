Living with the chronic pain of osteoarthritis (OA) can feel like a journey with only one destination: major surgery. For many suffering from aching knees or stiff hips, a total joint replacement can seem like an inevitable future. But what if there was a different path?

For many patients, particularly those in the earlier stages of OA, the journey doesn't have to lead directly to the operating table. World-class hospitals in Thailand are at the forefront of providing a wide range of advanced, less invasive treatments. These therapies focus on managing pain, improving function, and potentially delaying the need for a total joint replacement. This guide explores the full spectrum of care available before considering the scalpel.

### **Why a Personalised Treatment Plan is Key**

The most effective approach to osteoarthritis is not one-size-fits-all. The right treatment depends on the severity of your condition, your activity level, and your personal goals. Creating a personalised care plan with an expert is a crucial first step in finding the least invasive, most effective solution for you right now.

### **Advanced Non-Surgical Treatments Available in Thailand**

Top international hospitals offer sophisticated therapies that go far beyond standard painkillers. Our network of specialists at [](<https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/ J>)[JCI-accredited hospitals](<https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/ J>) in Thailand can provide a range of treatments for Osteoarthritis, from innovative PRP Therapy to advanced Total Knee Replacement.

**Some of the advanced non-surgical options include:**

* Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy: This innovative treatment uses the healing power of your own body. A small sample of your blood is spun in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets, which are rich in natural growth factors. This plasma is then injected directly into the affected joint to reduce inflammation, alleviate pain, and potentially support the repair of damaged cartilage.
* Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Injections (Viscosupplementation): Think of this as adding lubrication to your joint. HA is a substance that occurs naturally in the fluid that cushions your joints. In an osteoarthritic knee, this fluid can thin out. HA injections supplement this fluid, helping to improve lubrication, absorb shock, and reduce pain.
* Other Regenerative Options: Some specialised centres in Thailand also offer other advanced regenerative medicine techniques, which aim to use the body's primary cells to help repair and regenerate damaged tissues.

### **When is Joint Replacement Surgery the Right Answer?**

To build a trustworthy plan, it's important to be realistic. Non-surgical treatments can be highly effective, but for some, they may not be a permanent solution. A total knee or hip replacement is generally recommended when:

* You experience severe daily pain that is no longer managed by other treatments.
* Joint stiffness and immobility are significantly impacting your quality of life.
* X-rays show advanced joint damage where the cartilage has worn away completely.

A discussion with an orthopaedic specialist can help you weigh the benefits and decide when the time is right for surgery, whether it is a traditional or robotic-assisted procedure.
