For patients considering knee replacement surgery, the prospect of a long waiting list and high costs at home can be daunting. Increasingly, quality-focused individuals are looking abroad, and Thailand has emerged as a world-class destination for advanced medical procedures. At the forefront of this is robotic-assisted knee replacement, a state-of-the-art approach that offers enhanced precision and can lead to a faster, smoother recovery.

This guide delves into the specifics of robotic knee replacement in Thailand, focusing on leading systems like the **[Stryker Mako SmartRobotics™](https://www.stryker.com/us/en/joint-replacement/systems/mako-smartrobotics.html)** and the **[VELYS™ Robotic-Assisted Solution](https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/solution/velys-robotic-assisted-solution)**. We’ll explore the significant benefits, break down the costs, and explain what a physician-led concierge service adds to your journey.

### **The Patient Benefit: How Robotic-Assisted Surgery Works for You**

When you hear "robotic surgery," it’s not about a robot performing the operation independently. Rather, it’s a highly advanced tool that provides your expert surgeon with real-time data and a new level of precision tailored to your unique anatomy.

Here’s how that benefits you directly:

* **A Personalised Fit:** Before surgery, the system uses a CT scan to create a virtual 3D model of your knee. This allows your surgeon to plan the optimal position and fit of your new implant before any incision is made.
* **Enhanced Precision:** During the procedure, the robotic arm provides the surgeon with a defined area to work within, helping them execute the plan with pinpoint accuracy. This helps to protect healthy bone and surrounding soft tissues.
* **Potentially Faster Recovery:** Because the surgery is so precise and minimally disruptive to healthy tissue, many patients report a quicker recovery timeline and a more natural-feeling new knee.

For a detailed look at the typical recovery journey, see our **week-by-week guide to post-operative care**.

### **A Transparent Look at the Costs: Value Without Compromise**

One of the most compelling reasons to consider Thailand for a robotic knee replacement is the significant value, with savings often between 50-70% compared to private UK or US prices.

An all-inclusive package for a VELYS robotic knee replacement at a premier hospital like Bumrungrad International could be priced around $15,500. A comprehensive package facilitated by Sivara Health would transparently itemise all costs, so there are no surprises.

**A Sample All-Inclusive Robotic Knee Package Typically Includes:**

* The robotic-assisted surgical procedure itself.
* A high-quality implant from a leading manufacturer like[](https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en) Zimmer Biomet.
* All surgeon, anaesthetist, and hospital operating theatre fees.
* A private room for your post-operative hospital stay.
* All pre- and post-operative consultations with your Thai surgeon.
* In-hospital physiotherapy sessions to begin your rehabilitation.
* Our full premium concierge service, including airport transfers and 24/7 in-country support.
* A free virtual triage consultation with a **UK-licensed doctor before you travel**.
