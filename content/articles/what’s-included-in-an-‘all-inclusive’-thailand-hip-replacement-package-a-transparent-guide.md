The term ‘all-inclusive’ gets used a lot in medical tourism. While it sounds reassuring, it can also be a source of anxiety. What does it *actually* mean? Are there hidden fees? What happens if you need something that isn't on the list?

These are valid, important questions. When you are planning a significant procedure like a hip replacement in Thailand, you deserve complete transparency. A truly premium package isn’t just about covering costs; it’s about providing a seamless, supportive, and predictable experience from start to finish. This guide breaks down exactly what a world-class, all-inclusive hip replacement package contains, so you can see the value without any surprises.

### **The Clinical Core: Non-Negotiable Medical Inclusions**

At a minimum, any reputable package must cover every aspect of the clinical procedure. This is the foundation of your care.

* **All Surgeon & Hospital Fees:** This includes the fees for your expert orthopaedic surgeon, the anaesthesiologist, the operating theatre, and all standard medications used during your hospital stay.
* **A Private Hospital Room:** Your comfort during recovery is essential. A private room for the standard duration of your post-operative hospital stay is always included.
* **A High-Quality Hip Implant:** The quality of the implant is critical for long-term success. Our packages specify the use of high-quality, internationally recognised implants from leading manufacturers like **[Zimmer Biomet](https.www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/specialties/hip.html),** DePuy Synthes, or Smith & Nephew.
* **All Pre- and Post-Operative Consultations:** This covers your initial in-person consultation and examination with your Thai surgeon, as well as all necessary follow-up appointments in Thailand before you fly home.
* **In-Hospital Physiotherapy:** Your rehabilitation starts immediately. The initial physiotherapy sessions you receive while in the hospital are a crucial part of the package and your **successful recovery.**

### **The Sivara Health Difference: The Premium Concierge & Support Layer**

This is what separates a standard medical bill from a truly all-inclusive, stress-free experience. A premium concierge service wraps around the clinical core, managing every logistical detail so you can focus purely on your health. This is a standard part of every Sivara Health package.

Here’s what our comprehensive support service includes:

* **Expert Medical Oversight from the UK:** Before you even commit, your journey begins with a **free virtual triage consultation with a UK-licensed doctor.** This ensures your case is properly vetted by a trusted professional from a system you know.
* **A Dedicated Case Manager:** You will have a single point of contact—an expert in medical travel—who manages your entire journey, from answering initial questions to checking in on you post-surgery.
* **Seamless Logistics Management:** We handle the details that cause the most stress. This includes:
* * **Airport Meet & Greet:** You’ll be met at the airport by a friendly face and taken to your hotel in a private vehicle.

  * **Accommodation Support:** We help you choose and book accommodation that is comfortable and appropriate for your recovery.

  * **All Ground Transfers:** All scheduled transfers between your hotel and the hospital for appointments are included.
* **24/7 In-Country Support:** Having access to an on-the-ground team member via a 24/7 support line provides an invaluable safety net and complete peace of mind.

### **What’s Typically Not Included (And Why Transparency Matters)**

An honest provider will be upfront about what is outside the scope of a standard package. You should always be aware of:

* **Flights:** Package prices typically exclude airfare due to fluctuating costs and individual travel preferences. However, our concierge team can assist you with flight planning and suggestions.
* **Daily Living & Tourism:** Your personal expenses, meals outside of the hospital, and any tourism activities are not included.
* **Extended Stays:** The package will specify a standard length for the hospital and hotel stay. If you choose to extend your trip for personal reasons, these additional nights will be at your own expense.
* **Care for Unexpected Complications:** While complications are rare in **JCI-accredited facilities,** a transparent provider will have a clear process for how any unforeseen medical needs are managed.

### **The Sivara Health All-Inclusive Promise**

A truly "all-inclusive" hip replacement package should offer more than just a bundled price; it should offer peace of mind. It combines the clinical excellence of a **[JCI-accredited](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)** hospital and a leading surgeon with a comprehensive, empathetic support system that anticipates your needs. Our packages are designed this way because our physician-led founding team believes that outstanding care requires looking after the whole person, not just the procedure.
