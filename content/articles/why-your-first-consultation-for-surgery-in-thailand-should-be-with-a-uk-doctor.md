When considering orthopaedic surgery in Thailand, you’ve likely been impressed by the world-class hospitals and significant cost savings. But as you move from research to serious planning, a critical question should arise: "Who is the first person I will speak to about my medical needs?"

For many, the answer is a salesperson or a booking agent. We believe this is fundamentally the wrong approach. Before you think about booking flights or choosing a hospital, your first conversation should be a medical one. Specifically, it should be with a doctor who is licensed in and understands your home country's healthcare system. This isn't a luxury; it's an essential first step for ensuring your safety, confidence, and peace of mind.

### **The Sivara Health Philosophy: A Bridge of Trust**

The anxiety that many patients feel about medical travel isn’t just about the surgery; it’s about navigating an unfamiliar system. This is precisely why Sivara Health was founded by a unique partnership: a UK-trained physician and a Thai co-founder with a PhD in behavioural and medical sciences.

Their combined expertise created our "Trusted Expert Companion" model, designed to build a bridge of trust between you and the excellent medical system in Thailand. It ensures your journey is framed by medical expertise from a familiar perspective, not by sales targets. This physician-led approach is the cornerstone of our commitment to safe, high-quality surgery in Thailand.

### **What a UK Doctor's Virtual Triage Actually Provides**

This initial consultation is far more than just a chat. It’s a crucial part of the medical process that provides tangible benefits:

* An Initial Medical Assessment: The UK doctor can conduct a virtual triage, reviewing your medical history to provide an initial opinion on whether travelling for a procedure like a Total Knee Replacement (Procedure) at a [](http://https.www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)[JCI-accredited](https.www.jointcommissioninternational.org/) hospital in Thailand is a suitable option for you.
* Empowered and Informed Decision-Making: Unsure what to ask your surgeon in Thailand? Our UK doctor helps you prepare, ensuring you are equipped with the right questions about your procedure, recovery, and expected outcomes.
* Invaluable Peace of Mind: Knowing that a UK-licensed medical professional has personally reviewed your case provides immense reassurance before you commit your time and money. This is a vital comfort, both for you and for your family.
* A No-Obligation First Step: At Sivara Health, this is offered as a [free virtual triage](https://sivara.health/#consultation). It is a no-pressure opportunity for you to gain expert medical insight in a comfortable and familiar setting.

### **The Sivara Standard: Essential, Not Optional**

We don’t see this initial UK doctor consultation as an add-on; it is fundamental to our promise of providing a kind, caring, and premium service. It immediately sets a standard of care that differentiates us from impersonal booking platforms.

This first step ensures that your entire journey, as detailed in our step-by-step guide, is built on a foundation of trust. It guarantees that from the very beginning, your health and safety are the primary focus, shaping every subsequent recommendation, from the choice of hospital to the selection of your specialist Thai surgeon.
