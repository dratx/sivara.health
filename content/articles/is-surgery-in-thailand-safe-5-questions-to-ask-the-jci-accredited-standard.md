The truth is, the safety of surgery isn’t about the country; it’s about the *standard* of the hospital, the credentials of the surgeon, and the quality of the support system around you. Thailand is home to a network of truly world-class hospitals that meet rigorous global benchmarks. The key is knowing how to find them.

Here are five critical questions you should ask any provider before committing to medical travel.

#### **The Gold Standard: What is Joint Commission International (JCI)?**

Before we get to the questions, it’s vital to understand the benchmark for global hospital quality. The **[Joint Commission International (JCI)](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)** is a U.S.-based organisation that evaluates healthcare facilities worldwide. Hospitals with JCI accreditation have undergone a demanding evaluation of over 1,200 elements, from surgical safety to staff qualifications. It is recognised as the gold standard in global health care.

#### **1. Is the Hospital JCI-Accredited?**

This should be your first and non-negotiable question. A "yes" means the hospital operates at a level of safety and quality comparable to top hospitals in the UK or US. Sivara Health exclusively partners with **[JCI-accredited](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)** hospitals, such as the renowned **Bumrungrad International Hospital** and **Vejthani Hospital** in Bangkok, ensuring our patients receive care that meets the highest international standards.

#### **2. What are the Surgeon's Credentials and Experience?**

A great hospital is only part of the equation. You need an expert surgeon. Don’t hesitate to ask for specific details, including:

* Their medical training and specialisations.
* Their experience with your specific procedure, like **robotic-assisted knee replacement**.
* Affiliation with medical boards, both Thai and international. Sivara Health ensures you have this information to make an informed decision.

#### **3. Who is Vetting My Case Before I Travel?**

One of the most significant safety concerns is knowing if you are a suitable candidate for surgery abroad. This is where a crucial layer of expert oversight comes in. A key part of the Sivara Health promise is our **free virtual triage, conducted by a UK-licensed doctor**. Before you make any plans, our UK doctor reviews your case to provide initial advice, ensuring that travelling for treatment is an appropriate and safe option for you.

#### **4. What Support System is in Place on the Ground?**

Navigating a medical journey in another country can be stressful, and a dedicated support system is a critical safety component. Your support should include:

* A dedicated case manager who knows your case inside and out.
* 24/7 in-country support for any questions or concerns.
* Assistance with all logistics, from airport transfers to translation services.

This comprehensive support system is detailed in our **step-by-step guide to planning your medical trip**.

#### **5. How is My Post-Operative Care Managed?**

Safety doesn’t end when you leave the operating theatre. A well-managed recovery is vital for a successful outcome. We help you plan for this crucial phase by providing clear post-op instructions and liaising with your home-country GP to ensure a seamless continuity of care. You can read about this in our **guide to post-operative recovery in Thailand**.
