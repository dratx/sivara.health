In the world of international medical care, a reputation for excellence in a specific field is hard-earned. Vejthani Hospital has not only earned such a reputation but has become globally synonymous with elite-level orthopaedic care, earning it the widely-used nickname, the "King of Bones." For patients seeking highly specialised solutions for bone and joint conditions, Vejthani stands out as a premier destination.

##### **A Legacy of Orthopaedic Excellence**

Vejthani Hospital’s reputation is built on a foundation of verifiable quality. It has maintained its **[JCI accreditation](https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/)** since 2010, demonstrating a long-standing commitment to the highest global standards.

Crucially, it was the first hospital in Thailand to receive specific JCI Clinical Care Program Certifications (CCPC) for both its Total Knee Replacement and Total Hip Replacement programs. This is a rare and significant distinction, signifying that its specialised processes for these exact procedures have been rigorously vetted and approved by the world's leading healthcare accreditor.

##### **Advanced Orthopaedic Specialties**

While many hospitals offer general orthopaedics, Vejthani is structured around deep specialisation. This focus allows its surgeons to achieve outstanding outcomes in highly complex cases.

* **Complex Joint Revisions:** For patients whose previous hip or knee replacements have failed, Vejthani is a leading centre for revision arthroplasty, a technically demanding procedure requiring immense expertise.
* **Advanced Spine Surgery:** The hospital’s spine centre utilises cutting-edge technology like the O-arm navigation system, providing surgeons with real-time 3D imaging for enhanced precision during complex spinal fusions and decompressions.
* **Sports Medicine:** With a dedicated team and advanced arthroscopic techniques, the hospital helps athletes and active individuals recover from injuries and return to peak performance.

##### **Cutting-Edge Surgical Technology**

Vejthani is committed to investing in technology that directly improves patient outcomes. The hospital employs a range of advanced tools, including robotic-assisted surgical systems for joint replacements. This technology enables surgeons to execute their surgical plan with a higher degree of accuracy, which can lead to better implant longevity and a smoother, potentially faster **post-operative recovery**.

##### **Location & Accessibility**
