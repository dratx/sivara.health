If you are exploring options for hip replacement surgery, you are likely facing a difficult choice: endure a long and painful wait for NHS treatment or face the substantial expense of private healthcare in the UK. The cost of a private hip replacement can be a significant financial barrier, leaving many feeling trapped.

But what if there was a third option that offered timely, world-class treatment at a fraction of the price? This guide provides a transparent, detailed cost breakdown, comparing UK options with a premium, all-inclusive surgical package in Thailand. We will look beyond the headline numbers to explore the true value, factoring in quality of care, hospital standards, and the level of expert support you receive.

### **Understanding the Costs: More Than Just a Price Tag**

When comparing your options, it's crucial to look at the complete picture. The "cost" isn't just the final bill; it's also the time spent in pain waiting for treatment and the risk of unexpected expenses.

* **NHS Pathway:** The primary cost here isn't monetary but the physical and emotional toll of waiting, which can lead to deteriorating joint health and reduced quality of life.
* **UK Private Pathway:** This route offers speed but at a high price. Initial quotes may not include all expenses, such as consultations, diagnostic imaging, or post-operative physiotherapy.
* **Medical Tourism in Thailand:** This path provides an affordable, high-quality alternative without the wait. At Sivara Health, we ensure our **all-inclusive hip replacement packages** offer absolute transparency.

### **Cost Comparison: UK Private vs. All-Inclusive Thai Package**

While UK private costs can be opaque, a comprehensive package in Thailand bundles these elements into one clear price. When considering private healthcare, it's important to understand what is included in the quoted price. Below is a detailed breakdown of the components covered by a typical UK private sector estimate versus Sivara Health’s all-inclusive package in Thailand.

#### Sivara Health All-Inclusive Package

Our packages are designed to be comprehensive, ensuring clarity and peace of mind with no hidden costs. The package includes:

* Initial Consultation: A free virtual triage with a UK-licensed doctor is included.
* Pre-Operative Tests & Scans: All necessary pre-operative diagnostics are included.
* Surgeon & Anaesthetist Fees: All specialist fees are fully included.
* Hospital Stay: Your stay in a JCI-accredited hospital private room is included.
* Implant/Prosthesis Cost: We use high-quality brands like Zimmer Biomet, and the cost is included in the package.
* Post-Operative Medication: All required post-operative medication is included.
* In-Patient Physiotherapy: All necessary in-patient physiotherapy sessions are included.
* Follow-up Consultation: We include both pre-departure and remote follow-up support.
* Dedicated Concierge Service: This unique service, which includes airport transfers, 24/7 support, and translation services, is fully included.

#### Typical UK Private Sector

In the UK private sector, the initial quote typically includes the surgeon and anaesthetist fees, a standard-length hospital stay, post-operative medication, and initial physiotherapy sessions. However, several components may be billed separately or as additional fees, including:

* The initial consultation.
* Pre-operative tests and scans.
* Any follow-up consultations after the procedure.
* A dedicated concierge service is generally not applicable.

### Estimated Total Cost Comparison

* Typical UK Private Sector: £12,000 - £18,000
* Sivara Health All-Inclusive Package: £6,000 - £8,500, often saving over 60%!
